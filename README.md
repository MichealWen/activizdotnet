*by Kitware* https://www.kitware.eu/product/activiz
* Open-source software system for 3D visualization wrapped in C#
* Allows to quickly develop production-ready, interactive 3D applications in the .NET environment
* Built around the Visualization ToolKit VTK
* Supports a wide variety of visualization algorithms including scalar, vector, tensor, texture, and volumetric methods
* ActiViz includes advanced modeling techniques such as implicit modeling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting, contouring, and Delaunay triangulation

ActiViz .NET provides an integration layer for The Visualization Toolkit (see the next
section for more information about VTK) enabling VTK to be used in the Microsoft
.NET framework. This means that you can tap into the power of VTK using .NET
programming languages such as C# and Visual Basic .NET. ActiViz .NET is designed for
the application developer creating software in the Microsoft .NET framework. While the
system does come with a useful application (i.e., the Wikipedia Browser), realizing the
full power of ActiViz .NET requires you to write software programs.
